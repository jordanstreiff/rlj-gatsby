aboutParagraph: >
  The Randolph-Lucas Jones Houses is a Georgian Revival-style mansion built in
  1924 for Hollins Randolph, the great-great-grandson of Thomas Jefferson. It
  was later owned by Margaret Lucas until 1988 when it was sold to a developer
  and used as an event space. In 2013, it was set to be demolished, but was
  saved by Roger Smith and Christopher Jones, who bought and moved it to a
  vacant lot in Ansley Park, where it was extensively refurbished. Jones passed
  away in 2019, and the mansion was renamed in his honor. The house was honored
  with the Georgia Trust’s Excellence in Preservation Award in 2020, and
  previously by the Atlanta Preservation Center and the Daughters of the
  American Revolution’s local chapter. The effort to save the house was
  described as “one of the most significant preservation projects the city of
  Atlanta has had in years.”

moveParagraph: >
  In 2013, the Randolph-Lucas House was slated to be razed after falling into
  disrepair, but was saved by Roger Smith and Christopher Jones, who had it
  moved about two miles south in two pieces via tractor trailers to a vacant lot
  in Ansley Park. The move was a monumental task, as the house was a large
  mansion built in 1924 and located on Peachtree Road in Buckhead. After the
  move, Smith and Jones extensively refurbished the home, and it was renamed the
  Randolph Lucas Jones House in honor of Jones after his death in 2019. The move
  and restoration were significant preservation projects in the city of Atlanta,
  and the house has received several awards and recognition for its historical
  and architectural significancessss.
